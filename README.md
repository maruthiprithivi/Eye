Eyes
======
### Exercise on eyes:

**Description:** In this exercise two eyes were created using a combination of HTML and CSS. Using the power of JavaScript we're tracking the current location of the mouse pointer on the browser window were are dynamically changing the X and Y axis of the eye balls to follow the pointer.

**Usage:** Download the code repository to your computer, load the `index.html` in your web browser. Move your mouse pointer inside the browser window and the eye balls will follow it.

**Roadmap:** Make the eyes move idependently and maybe add eye lids with open and close actions...
